## WHY DID I MAKE THIS?

# Mostly a passion project, but also for other reasons.

# I wanted a way for a browser to be simple but customizable, thus making it faster than other browsers.

## WARNING

# Take note of that this browser WILL take about 30 seconds to load because of initilization but after initlization, it works like a charm!

## THE END
